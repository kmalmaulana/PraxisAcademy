### Row

A widget that displays its children in a horizontal array. Row widget can't be scroll. If you have just one child, then consider to use Align or Center to position the child.

The runApp() function takes the given Widget and makes it the root of the widget tree. In this example, the widget tree consists of two widgets, the Center widget and its child, the Text widget. The framework forces the root widget to cover the screen, which means the text “Hello, world” ends up centered on screen.
