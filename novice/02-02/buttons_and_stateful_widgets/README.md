## Code Explanation
### Raised Button

Here is Raiseb Button Widget that define information such as ``color``, ``fontStyle``, ``fontSize``, and ``buttonColor`` it self. Button Widget are inside the ``Container``.


```dart
new RaisedButton(
                  child: new Text("Press me!",
                      style: new TextStyle(
                          color: Colors.white,
                          fontStyle: FontStyle.italic,
                          fontSize: 20.0)),
                  color: Colors.red,

  int counter = 0;
  List<String> strings = ["Flutter", "Is", "Awesome"];
  String displayedString = "";

  //you can also declare variables like this
  // var counter = 0;
  // var strings = ["Flutter", "Is", "Awesome"];

  void onPressed() {
    setState(() {
      displayedString = strings[counter];
      counter = counter < 2 ? counter + 1 : 0;
